        <h3> Here's an unordered list including facts about me - and some hyperlinks! </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> I'm a student at the <a href="https://umich.edu/">University of Michigan</a> majoring in Computer Science in the College of Literature, Science and the Arts. </li>
            <li> I want to become a fullstack developer because I partically love web development, and the thrill of being able to create aesthetic AND interative websites is really exciting to me! </li>
            <li> To start my journey towards this goal, I'm creating a portfolio to document my progress. This website will be my reference to test out new elements and features as I continue learning. </li>
